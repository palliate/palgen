Palgen is a powerful and modular command line tool aiming to simplify writing various common utilities such as build scripts, code generators and preprocessors. Palgen provides an easy-to-use interface for creating command line applications by automatically generating command line interfaces (CLIs) from pydantic schemas. This allows for file-based configurations and setting validation.

## Features

- Modular architecture. Once your user provided class inherits from palgen's `Module` interface it will be recoginized as module and become runnable.
- Automatic generation of command line interfaces.
- Configuration settings validation using pydantic.
- Easy integration with existing Python projects.
- Easy-to-use ingest pipelines for processing data.
- Automatic parallelization of Module pipelines unless disabled.
- Comprehensive documentation available at [palgen.palliate.io](https://palgen.palliate.io).

```shell
pip install palgen
